DAY 3 DBMS REVISIT

ADVANTAGES OF DBMS 
	-no redudancy
	-memory management
	-consitency in data
	-easy access
	-security
	-concurrency
 
 ARCHITECTURE IN DBMS:
 
	dbms possess external level,conceptual level,physical level
	external level can be used by user
	conceptual level visible to users but unaware of the storage
	physical level not visible and cant able to see the storage
	
 -TWO TIER ARCHITECTURE
	same as client and server model but as an API to connect the client with the server side using api like odbc,jdbc
	Open Database Connectivity (ODBC ),java database connectivity(JDBC)
	
 -THREE TIER ARCHITECTURE
    same as two tier architecture but three tier has a extra layer knows as application layer or GUI layer to make the computation more user friendly

data's in the database is stored in form of objects 
indexing happens so fast in DBMS since they are stored in the form of objects.

DATA ABSTRACTION 
-data abstraction is achieved by physical,logical,view level

DATABASE OBJECT:
	table,view,synonym,index,sequence
	
ENTITY:
		an entity is a object with physical features like a employee,person,car
		entity is a onject of entity type set of all entity is called entity set
ATTRIBUTES:
        properties which define entity type like roll no,subject denotes student entity
KEY_ATTRIBUTE:
        attribute which uniquely identifies an entity set ex:ROLL NO
COMPOSITE ATTRIBUTE
        A attribute with with comprises many attributes like address attribute which has door no,street etc
MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTE:
			An attribute consisiting more than one value student attribute has two to three phone numbers
DERVIED ATTRIBUTE:
				attributes that are dervied from other attributes
